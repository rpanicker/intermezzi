## Itinerant Intermezzi

### What's this all about?
I hope these series of posts prove useful to someone out there ... besides me of course! The aim is to publish atleast once a month about a subject that I find interesting. 

I dont have a specific intent or subject in mind. I hope to simply record my ideas about things I have read or seen and about learnings from my experiences.
